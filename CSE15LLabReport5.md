Phillip: 
Hello, I am Phillip Mai and I would like some help with my center pivot partitioner method. It's supposed to partition a String array based on a pivot at the center, so that all the elements less than the pivot are to the left of the pivot, and all elements bigger than the pivot are to the right. Right now my code isn't working when I run the tests. Here is a screenshot of my failure test.

I don't know what the bug is, it seems like the method isn't running to the very end because the last element remains the same. The last element should be "N" but instead it is "H". I think there is something wrong that makes it so that my code isn't reaching the last for-loop.
